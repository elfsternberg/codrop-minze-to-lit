# Lit Demo

Demo of a fictive Smart Home dashboard application.

This is a small collection of web components written with [Lit](https://lit.dev), intended to
showcase several basic techniques in web components. See the accompanying [article](./ARTICLE.md)
for an in-depth tutorial on what and how it works. A copy of the article (with better styling) can
be found [on my blog](https://elfsternberg.comblog/minze-to-lit-conversion/).
